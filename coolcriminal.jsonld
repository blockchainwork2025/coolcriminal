    "motivations": "My passion for blockchain technology and decentralized governance has driven my career for over five years. As a Blockchain Engineer, NFT creator, and full-stack developer, I have built and contributed to projects that push the boundaries of decentralization, security, and user empowerment across multiple chains. Now, I want to leverage my expertise to play an active role in shaping governance as a DRep.\n\nWhy I Want to Be a DRep\nI believe that decentralized governance is the key to building trustless, transparent, and resilient ecosystems. With my background in smart contract development (Solidity and other languages), blockchain gaming, and NFT marketplace design, I have seen firsthand how decision-making impacts the sustainability of projects. I want to bring a builder’s perspective to governance—ensuring that decisions are technically sound, fair, and aligned with the long-term vision of the ecosystem.\n\nPersonal and Professional Experiences to Share\nTechnical Expertise in Blockchain",
